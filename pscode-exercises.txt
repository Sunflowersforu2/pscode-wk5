// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers

d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

(a) 1,2,3,4,5
b) 1+2+3+4+5= 15 and then 15 divided by 5
c)If it is 1= smallest; if it is 5= largest
d) For b) average is 3; for c) smallest is 1 and largest is 5)
